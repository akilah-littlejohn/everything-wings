=== File Names
1. No numerical characters
2. Mongoose model files must start with capital letter
3. Files with multiple words must be seperated by underscore (_) or hyphen(-).

=== Comments
1. Each new defined function must have comment describing functionality
2. Mulit-line comments are okay

=== Quotes
1. Single quote everything except JSON

=== Code Script
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript ES5 or ES6

=== Javascript Promises
1. Must be written as async/await with try/catch blocks
2. Any .then().catch() must be refactored into async/await if you need help reach out

=== Controllers
1. Name must contain route type and model name and what it's for
Example: /*
    exports.postRegisterUser = async(req,res)=>{
      // Do stuff
    }
*/

=== Routes
1.Route files must use object destructuring when importing controllers from other files

Example: /*
    const router = require('express').Router();
    const {postRegisterUser} = require('../controllers/user-controllers');
*/

2. Route setup must follow this format:

Example: /*
    router
    .route("/<param or route name>")
    .post(postRegisterUser) // for any http request type
*/

=== Indentation
1. Use prettier or linter that formats on save.
2. If no linter is used tabbing is ok. No spaces.

=== Trailing SemiColons
1. PLEASE USE TRAILING SEMICOLONS, some IDEs will break if all JS functionality doesn't have
a trailing SemiColons



CAN'T Think of anything else right now. If you can feel free to add below "END" line and suggestions
that fit will be added later
